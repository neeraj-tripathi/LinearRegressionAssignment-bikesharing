## General Information
MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION - Model for Predicting Demand For Bike Sharing 

Consider a Bike Sharing Company that has dataset about number of users using shared bike based on different variables like temp etc.

The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands

We will perform analysis and build model in steps as below.

1. Data Reading and Understanding
2. Data cleaning and preparation
3. Create a linear model for prediction
4. Know the acuracy of model

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis
Temperation impacts the bike sharing.
- Conclusion 2 from the analysis
People take more bikes in summer and fall temperature.
- Conclusion 3 from the analysis
People use bike more from April to October
